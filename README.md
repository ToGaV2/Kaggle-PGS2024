# Kaggle-PGS2024
Kaggle Playground Competition Notebooks from Series 4 (2024). These competitions are conducted on synthetic data generated by GAN networks. The training set is roughly 60% to 75% of the generated data, and the competition is scored on the remainder. Since the data is machine generated prior to the split, and there are always observations that could not exist in the real world, this is a fairly pure data science competition. The data comes with outliers, noise, and observations with disqualifying inputs. Yet, because the training and testing data are both machine generated, Subject Matter Expertise yields no advantage. (I.E. the V8 gasoline powered Teslas in Episode 9.)

## Notebook Names:
These notebooks tend to adhere to a naming convention of S4E11 meaning S***series number***E***episode number*** and the type of algorithm run in the notebook. There are examples of Catboost (CAT), XGBoost (XGB), Light Gradient Boosting Machines (LGBM), Neural Networks (NN), Histogram Gradient Boosting (HGBR & HGBC), classical Linear Regression (LM), generalized additive regression models (GAM), and much exploratory data analysis (EDA). Hopefully, these examples help somebody out at some point. Thanks for taking a look.

## Results:
- Episode 8: Binary Classification of Poisonous Mushrooms (Ranked 174 / 2422 Teams - Top 8%)
- Episode 9: Regression of Used Car Prices (Ranked 209 / 3066 Teams - Top 7%)
- Episode 10: Loan Approval Prediction (Ranked 205 / 3858 Teams - Top 6%)
- Episode 11: Exploring Mental Health Data (Depression Prediction Classifier) (Competition Underway)
